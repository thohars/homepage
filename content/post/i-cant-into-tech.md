I said previously that I want to rewrite [/rss](/rss) using Nginx so that it points directly to my main RSS feed. Guess what? On the first post, I also said that I stopped using VPS. It means that I don't have Nginx anymore. How of a fool I am! I completely forgot.

Oh, well. Maybe I will use thoha.xyz in the near future.
