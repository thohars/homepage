Good day, zoomers.

I got a new VPS! That means I can use nginx again and finally do the [/rss](/rss) rewrite thingy. So, if you make a request to [https://thoha.xyz/rss](https://thoha.xyz/rss), it'll be rewritten to my main RSS feed. Still, it won't work on [https://thoha.surge.sh/rss](https://thoha.surge.sh/rss), so don't use it.

Let's use Surge as a mirror/backup.
