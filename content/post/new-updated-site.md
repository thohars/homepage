Hey.

Yes, of course I haven't forgotten about this site. I use Hugo now instead of creating my own webserver on Node with Nginx as reverse proxy (it's so tedious). Also, I can't afford to rent VPS.

By the way, all of the previous posts are gone and so is the main RSS feed. I don't want to rewrite them.
